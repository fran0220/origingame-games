# Hullbreaker projectile chassis atlases

`projectile-chassis-atlas-v3.png` is the production 1536×256 alpha atlas.
Its six 256×256 cells are ordered `R`, `S`, `L`, `H`, `F`, `G`. Version 3
re-authors all six bodies as compact pixel sprites with hard ink silhouettes,
minimal interior shading, and one consistent muzzle axis. They are designed
for the 12–22 px size actually produced by the FAR camera, rather than as
large illustrations later reduced by more than 10:1. `pixel-v1/` retains the
untouched six-cell ImageGen source and the independently reusable cells.

`pixel-v1/projectile-pixel-pack-v1.json` records the source, chroma rule,
packing geometry, order, and hashes.

## Earlier painted atlas

`projectile-chassis-atlas-v1.png` is the runtime 1280×256 alpha atlas. Its
five 256×256 cells are ordered `R`, `S`, `L`, `H`, `F`. The production atlas
is loaded once and each projectile pool selects its cell with geometry UVs.

`projectile-chassis-atlas-chroma-v1.png` is the untouched built-in ImageGen
source. It is retained for provenance and future repacking.

The `S` cell was replaced on 2026-08-04 with one narrow manufactured
flechette selected from
`projectile-scatterbloom-flechette-candidates-v1.png`. Scatterbloom already
creates five independent simulation pellets; drawing five darts inside every
pellet made a volley resemble a flock of small enemies. The replacement is a
single 230×53 px alpha silhouette (4.34:1) centered in the same 256 px cell.
At the shipped FAR view it resolves to roughly 16×4 display pixels. No
simulation count, collision, damage, speed, atlas dimensions, cell order, or
pixels in the `R`, `L`, `H`, and `F` cells changed.

Version 2 added the `G` ground-fire cell and remains as the painted A/B source.

`projectile-scatterbloom-flechette-provenance-v1.json` records the built-in
ImageGen output identity, the non-verbatim candidate prompt summary, selected
grid cell, chroma-removal settings, packing geometry, and decoded RGBA hashes.

## Final ImageGen prompt

```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: production 2D game projectile chassis sprite atlas for Hullbreaker
Primary request: create exactly five strongly distinct industrial sci-fi projectile bodies as isolated painted sprites. They are ammunition fired by the five weapons in Image 1 and must share that weapon sheet's hand-painted hard-surface machinery, burnt-orange brackets, ivory armor, near-black steel seams, rivets, believable wear, and controlled luminous cores. Image 2 is mood and palette reference only, not a composition to copy.
Scene/backdrop: perfectly flat solid #00ff00 chroma-key background for local background removal. The background must be one uniform color with no shadow, gradient, texture, reflection, floor plane, lighting variation, or glow spill.
Composition/framing: exact clean 3 columns by 2 rows atlas layout with equal invisible cells, no dividers or borders. All five projectiles are strict side-profile, horizontal, pointing right, isolated, centered in their cell, with generous padding and no overlap. Top row left-to-right: riveted kinetic sabot; scatter flechette cluster; narrow prismatic Sunspear. Bottom row left-to-right: finned Hunger seeker missile; jagged caged Cindermouth ember; final bottom-right cell completely empty. Each projectile should fill about 72% of its cell width and have a bold readable silhouette at tiny gameplay scale.
Subject details:
1) RIVET SABOT: long cream-metal penetrator nose, clipped hexagonal profile, split dark sabot rails around the rear, one burnt-orange locking band, two or three unmistakable rivet heads; manufactured, dense, not a generic bullet.
2) SCATTER FLECHETTE: one compact integrated cluster of five separate triangular steel darts in a shallow fan, dark central launch collar and orange retaining clips; the five tips must remain individually readable, no explosion and no loose particles.
3) SUNSPEAR: extremely narrow cyan prismatic energy crystal captured between two ivory-black tuning prongs, sharp spear tip, small copper focusing cage at the rear; long clean angular silhouette, not a laser line.
4) HUNGER SEEKER: dark compact missile with a bright hot-magenta guidance chamber, hooked forward sensor, four large asymmetrical burnt-orange steering fins and visible side thruster ports; predatory mechanical silhouette, not a fish or insect.
5) CINDERMOUTH EMBER: angular orange-white plasma shard physically trapped inside a jagged black-and-rust mechanical claw cage, broken sawtooth silhouette and split rear vents; dangerous furnace hardware, not a fireball.
Style/medium: polished hand-painted game sprite art, stylized industrial realism, crisp hard edges, restrained surface detail, slight three-quarter material lighting while retaining strict side-on silhouettes, near-black 2–3 pixel-equivalent perimeter separation.
Color palette: ivory and warm white, burnt orange and copper, near-black steel; cyan only for Sunspear core, hot magenta only for Hunger chamber, orange-white only for Cindermouth core. Do not use any green anywhere in the subjects.
Constraints: exactly five projectile sprites and one empty cell; no weapons, guns, hands, characters, enemies, scenery, labels, text, letters, numbers, icons, arrows, logos, watermark, cast shadows, bloom cloud, smoke, exhaust trail, muzzle flash, motion blur, halo, perfect ring, circular badge, decorative particles, cell border, or grid line. Crisp separated edges suitable for chroma-key extraction.
Avoid: round blobs, eggs, balls, capsules, generic glowing lines, neon clipart, smooth gummy shapes, white additive bars, excessive micro-detail that disappears when reduced, bad crops, touching cell boundaries.

## Extraction and packing

The installed ImageGen chroma helper sampled `#07f806` from the border and
removed it with soft matte, despill, and a one-pixel edge contraction. The
five connected subjects were cropped independently, resized inside 230×230
bounds, centered in 256×256 transparent cells, and packed in the runtime
order above. A detached seven-pixel source fragment beside Scatter was
explicitly rejected before the final pack.

## Scatterbloom replacement extraction

The 4×4 candidate board used a flat green background. Candidate 15 (bottom
right, zero-based) was selected because its charcoal exhaust collar, copper
retainer, ivory penetrator, and continuous pointed axis remain distinct at 6,
10, and 20 px while never forming wings, claws, a thorax, or a multi-dart fan.
The installed ImageGen chroma helper sampled `#09f90f` from the board border
and removed it with soft matte, despill, and a one-pixel edge contraction. The
candidate's 254×58 alpha bounds were Lanczos-resized into 230×53 bounds,
centered at `(13, 101)` in the existing `S` cell, and packed without touching
the other four decoded cells.
